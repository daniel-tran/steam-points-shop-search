# FAQ

## Why I can't find a particular item?

This can be due to, but not strictly limited to:

1. The item has been removed from the Points Shop.
2. The item is only available through the Steam Community Market. For example, the [Holiday Sale 2015 cookie emoticon](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/425280-%3A2015cookie%3A).
3. The data file in this repository has not been updated.
4. Something is wrong with your search text.

## Why aren't the cost of Item Bundles shown properly?

For some unknown reason, the Steam API data sets the cost of item bundles to 0, and it's generally easier to have the user find the item bundle's price on the specific app's Points Shop page rather than manually calculating the cost through data aggregation.

## Steam does has an official search function for the Points Shop. Why would I want to use this search tool?

The in-built Points Shop search function provided by Valve might be all you need but it is particularly limiting, ~~given that it will only search based on games that you currently own~~. Also, you need to be logged into Steam in order to use the in-built search function.

This tool aims to provide a more robust searching capability, particularly around finding individual items, with some basic sorting criteria.

If the in-built search mechanism for the Points Shop is improved such that it matches or supercedes what this tool has to offer, then this repository will mostly likely be archived and cease being hosted via GitHub Pages.

**7/12/2022 UPDATE**: Valve have refined the Points Shop searching mechanism such that it's now an *actual search bar* to find items of a particular type (e.g. backgrounds, avatars, etc.). It still has its odd quirks, such a search text containing a full stop sometimes returning items that neither have a dot in their names nor the games that they come from, but overall mostly usable.
